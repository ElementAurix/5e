			<p>From a dexterous soldier picked for his speed, to a young villager looking for new lands to settle, there are many reasons one might pick or be picked for a life of scouting, but to be sure, being light of foot and hardened of spirit is a must. You will be the first to leave camp in the morning to get information on the path ahead and likely last to return to your comrades at the end of the night. Being far from base camp or your home for extend periods of time has shown you the value in being able to harvest the land around you to heal your wounds and mend your equipment, you cannot count the times the one extra arrow you made at your fire, or the repairs you made to your armor has saved your life.</p>
